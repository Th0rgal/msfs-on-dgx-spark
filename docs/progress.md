# Progress Log

## 2026-02-27

Validated on live DGX Spark host `spark-de79`:

- `scripts/01-fix-vulkan.sh`: Vulkan already active on NVIDIA driver `580.95.05`.
- `scripts/02-install-fex-steam.sh`: Steam Snap installed and launches on ARM64.
- `scripts/03-configure-msfs.sh`: created `~/launch-msfs.sh`.
- `scripts/04-setup-streaming.sh`: updated to install Sunshine from the official `.deb` release URL (Snap no longer available for this path).
- Headless stack is operational: `Xvfb :1`, `openbox`, `steam`, and `x11vnc` on `127.0.0.1:5901`.
- Re-verified live on 2026-02-27 01:16 UTC: Steam is reachable on `DISPLAY=:1` and currently blocked at Steam Guard code prompt for account login.

Current blocker for full end-to-end launch:

- Steam login requires a fresh Steam Guard email code for account authentication.
- Until Steam Guard is completed, MSFS `AppID 1250410` cannot be queued/installed, so launch verification remains pending.
- `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/appmanifest_1250410.acf` is still missing in the current account session (not installed yet).

Artifacts:

- `output/steam-root-latest.png` captures the live Steam Guard prompt.
- `output/steam-state-now3.png` captures the current Steam Guard prompt from the latest live session.

Next command after Steam Guard completion:

```bash
./scripts/05-resume-headless-msfs.sh install
```

Then after download completes:

```bash
./scripts/05-resume-headless-msfs.sh launch
```

Optional verification at any time:

```bash
./scripts/06-verify-msfs-state.sh
```
